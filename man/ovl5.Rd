\title{Index of overlap between circular distributions.}
\usage{
ovl5(fit1, fit2)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit1, fit2}{Fitted activity models of class actmod created using function fitact.}
}
\value{
Scalar overlap index (specifically Dhat5).
}
\description{
Calculates Dhat5 overlap index (see reference) between two kernel distributions .
}
\details{
Uses linear interpolation to impute values from kernel distributions.
}
\examples{
data(BCItime)
oceAct <- fitact(subset(BCItime, species=="ocelot")$time*2*pi)
broAct <- fitact(subset(BCItime, species=="brocket")$time*2*pi)
ovl5(oceAct, broAct)
